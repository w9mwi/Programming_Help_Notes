The graphical user interface for an Android app is built using
a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects.  View objects are
usually UI widgets such as buttons or text fields.  ViewGroup
objects are invisible view containers that define how the child
views are laid out, such as in a grid or a vertical list.
