CREATE GIT REPOSITORY - FROM YOUR COMPUTER VIA THE COMMAND LINE:
                        1) Create a new directory that will hold your new software project.
                        2) From the comand line, run the following:
                           > git init
                           > dir .git   (You should now see a new .git folder that was created.)
                           > git status (You should now see text that reveals the git status.)
DETERMINE GIT STATUS  - From command line, run:
                           > git status
DELETE GIT REPOSITORY - FROM YOUR COMPUTER VIA THE COMMAND LINE:
                        Go to the top-level directory/folder of your project (aka, the git repository),
                        then delete the .git folder, which may be invisible.  Doing this deletes the
                        git repository.  You can then delete all other files/folders from this folder
                        to make it completely empty.
WORKING DIRECTORY - The top-level directory/folder that contains all files and subdirectories
                    that comprise your software project.
